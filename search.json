Other similar services are, for example, bitbucket and GitLab. A cloud service gives you a cloud back up of your work and makes collaboration with co-workers easy.\nHere is a collection of online Git exersices that I used for Git training in other courses that I taught.\nTips on using Git:\n\nUse the command line interface instead of the web interface (e.g., upload on GitHub)\nMake frequent small commits instead of rare large commits.\nMake commit messages informative and meaningful.\nName your files/folders by some reasonable convention.\n\nLower cases are better than upper cases.\nNo blanks in file/folder names.\n\nKeep the repo clean by not tracking generated files.\nCreat a .gitignore file for better output from git status.\nKeep the linewidth of sources to under 80 for better git diff view.\n\nTo set up GitHub (other services like Bitbucket or GitLab are similar), you need to\n\nGenerate an SSH key if you don’t have one already.\nSign up an GitHub account.\nAdd the SSH key to your GitHub account\n\nThe most frequently used Git commands are:\n\ngit clone\ngit pull\ngit status\ngit add\ngit remove\ngit commit\ngit push"

    "text": "Data science projects should be reproducible to be trustworthy. Dynamic documents facilitate reproducibility. Quarto is an open-source dynamic document preparation system, ideal for scientific and technical publishing. From the official websites, Quarto can be used to:\n\nCreate dynamic content with Python, R, Julia, and Observable.\nAuthor documents as plain text markdown or Jupyter notebooks.\nPublish high-quality articles, reports, presentations, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more.\nAuthor with scientific markdown, including equations, citations, crossrefs, figure panels, callouts, advanced layout, and more.\n\nOf course, Quarto can be used to write homework, exams, and reports in this course,.\nTo get started, see documentation at Quarto."

Make sure you have clear messages to document the changes.\n\nWrite a function to demonstrate the Monty Hall problem through simulation. The function takes two arguments ndoors and ntrials, representing the number of doors in the experiment and the number of trails in a simulation, respectively. The function should return the proportion of wins for both the switch and no-switch strategy. Apply your function with 3 doors and 5 doors, both with 1000 trials. Include sufficient text around the code to explain your them.\nWrite a function to do a Monte Carlo approximation of \\(\\pi\\). The function takes a Monte Carlo sample size n as input, and returns a point estimate of \\(\\pi\\) and a 95% confidence interval. Apply your function with sample size 1000, 2000, 4000, and 8000.
