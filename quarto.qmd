# Reproducibile Data Science with Quarto

Data science projects should be reproducible to be trustworthy. Dynamic
documents facilitate reproducibility. [Quarto](https://quarto.org) is an
open-source dynamic document preparation system, ideal for scientific and
technical publishing. From the official websites, Quarto can be used to:

+ Create dynamic content with Python, R, Julia, and Observable.
+ Author documents as plain text markdown or Jupyter notebooks.
+ Publish high-quality articles, reports, presentations, websites, blogs, and
  books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more.
+ Author with scientific markdown, including equations, citations, crossrefs,
  figure panels, callouts, advanced layout, and more.
  
Of course, Quarto can be used to write homework, exams, and reports in this
course.
