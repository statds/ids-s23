# Project Management with Git

Many tutorials are available in different formats. Here is a [YouTube video
``Git and GitHub for Beginners --- Crash
Course''](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk)
<!-- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=USjZcfj8yxE). -->
The video also covers GitHub, a cloud service for Git. Other similar services
are, for example, [bitbucket](bitbucket.org) and [GitLab](gitlab.com). A cloud
service gives you a cloud back up of your work and makes collaboration with
co-workers easy.


Here is a collection of [online Git exersices](https://gitexercises.fracz.com)
that I used for Git training in other courses that I taught.


Tips on using Git:

+ Use the command line interface instead of the web interface (e.g., upload on GitHub)
+ Make frequent small commits instead of rare large commits.
+ Make commit messages informative and meaningful.
+ Name your files/folders by some reasonable convention. 
    - Lower cases are better than upper cases.
    - No blanks in file/folder names.
+ Keep the repo clean by not tracking generated files.
+ Creat a `.gitignore` file for better output from `git status`.
+ Keep the linewidth of sources to under 80 for better `git diff` view.
